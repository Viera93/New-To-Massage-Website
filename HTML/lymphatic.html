				<b>Lymphatic Drainage</b> is a therapeutic massage treatment. The massage uses very light pressure and long, gentle, rhytmic strokes to increase the flow
				   of the lymph. This technique is supposed to help remove waste and toxins from the body.</p>
				<p>Treatment usually takes place in a heated room, as warmth is an important factor in increasing lymphatic flow. You are also likely
                   to be more relaxed if you are not cold.</p>	
				   
			    <p><b>Lymphatic system</b><p>
			    <p>The lymphatic system primarily consists of lymphatic vessels, which are similar to the veins and capillaries of the circulatory system.
				   The vessels are connected to lymph nodes, where the lymph is filtered.
				   The tonsils, adenoids, spleen and thymus are all part of the lymphatic system.
				   The primary function of the Lymphatic system is to transport lymph, a fluid containing infection-fighting white blood cells, throughout the body.
				   Unlike blood, which flows throughout the body in a continue loop, lumph flows in only one direction - upward toward neck.
				   Lymphatic vessels connect to two subclavian veins, which are located on either sides of the neck near the collarbones,
				   and the fluid re-enters the circulatory system.</p>	
                <p>The most common deseases of the Lymphatic system are enlargement of the lymph nodes <b>(lymphadenopathy)</b>, swelling due to lymph node blockage
				<b>(lymphedema)</b> and cancers inolving the lymphatic systems.
                   When bacteria are recognized in the lymph fluid, lymph nodes	make more infection-fighting white blood cells, which can cause swelling.
                   The swallen nodes can sometimes be felt in the neck, underarm and groin.</p>
